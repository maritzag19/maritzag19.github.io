<p> How I came to this work</p>

<br> <h3> Methodology </h3>

<p> I am working with three data sets that come from the National Institute of Statistics and Geography which is a Mexican agency and from the Mexican consulate in the United states. The first data set focuses on migration to the united states from mexico in 1992-2016 which I am still cleaning because the data from 2016 is very clean and to the point but they have not digitized the rest of the data so I am essentially inputting those numbers from reports they have on their website. . So for now the visualization on the site just shows the 2016 number of migrations. I appreciate this data set though because it is one of the few data sets on migration to the US that shows the number of people migrating by state not just in general. Therefore, what I hope to show with this data is the migration patterns from the state of Guerrero and how they have changed since the early 1990s. Due to the rise of narco and state violence in Guerrero I am expecting the numbers to be rising, as more and more people flee for their safety. Another Data Set I am working with is the number of Indigenous Speakers in different cities of Guerrero, Mexico as of 2016. Although this data is limiting due to the fact that many Indigenous people tend to keep their native language a secret because of racism/state violence, which means the data is not truly representative of the total population of speakers. It is also not an indicator of how many Indigenous peoples there are in the general population since not all Indigenous people speak their language anymore.( I also found it interesting that most data sets I found use language as the indicator for Indigeneity)y. Even with these limitations it was helpful for me to further complicate the conversation on who it is that is migrating. Up until recently migration from Latin American has been homogenized under a nation state identifier. What I hope to show is that these waves of migration are predominately Indigenous, and the implications this will have on Indigenous communities/futures. The last data set I am working with is from the Mexican consulate in the U.S. which shows which cities have the largest migration from Guerrero. I hope to show where it is that the diaspora in the U.S. and see what kind of community has formed there. For example one of the cities largely populated by Guerrereses is Santa Ana which has many community gatherings around food </p>
