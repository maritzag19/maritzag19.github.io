<br> <h2> Memory, Kinship, and Futurities </h2>

<p class="demopara"> The Guerrerense Food Diasporas project began with an idea to create a collaborative digital cookbook, where the Guerrero Diaspora living in the United States could share and connect with one another. What I focused on this quarter was building the foundations and layout for the digital cookbook. I also realized the importance of contextualizing where Guerrero is (both in Mexico and the United States), who is from there, and why we migrate. This context is important in order to capture the as much of the story/stories that then show why collecting these recipes is important in the first place. So, beyond the context, this digital humanities project still ended up being about food and recipes, but what also arose from collecting these recipes were conversations on memory, kinship, and futurities. Thus, this project aims to capture the stories of Indigenous Guerrerenses living in diaspora and the ways they stay connected to their roots, families, and communities. One of those ways being through the passing down of food and the traditional foodways. </p>

<p class="demopara">The Guerrerense Food Diasporas Project focuses on the people of Guerrero who have migrated to the United States, but who keep their culture alive through their foodways. I argue that memory and kinship play a central role in how food stories and foodways are transmitted across space-time. I also argue that diasporic Guerrerense communities are re-creating home and, in the process, enact futurities.</p>

<p class="demopara"> Indigenous Diasporas from Latin America have been documented by scholars focused on the rise in Oaxacan Indigenous and Maya communities in Los Angeles (Blackwell, 2017; Boj Lopez, 2017). Much of the literature has focused on major events held by those communities, and the creation of hometown associations which provides them with a direct link to their homelands. There is a minimal research on the more intimate formation of communities and those led by the children of those who migrated. I aim to provide this perspective with my work by sharing stories both from my perspective as a first-generation diasporic Nahua Guerreresense, and by highlighting the way my community creates community around food in more intimate settings such as the home. </p>

<p class="demopara"> The spatial and temporal interventions I aim to make are centered around different ways of making community in Diaspora, that center the physical, digital, and spiritual realms. It is in all these realms that diasporic Guerreresense communities are engaging with one another and sharing their cultures with one another in hopes of carrying on their traditions. I also aim to show how Indigenous people in diaspora are mapping new ways of knowing away from their original homelands, while maintaining their roots. It shows how Indigenous people refuse to be eliminated, and how we continue to rebuild home and futures even after being derooted, displaces, and deterritorialized. Thus memory, kinship, and futurities are the tools that keep our communities alive in diaspora.

<br> <h3> Methodology </h3>

<p class="demopara"> In Digital Humanities we are taught to think critically both of the tools, platforms, and data sets we are working with. We are always asked to think about the limitations of the data sets, and be critical of not reinforcing ideas that think of data as neutral (Drucker, 2011; Zer-Aviv, 2016; Rawson et. all , 2016; Kurgan et. all, 2019). Another major question posed is how to bring a humanist approach to digital technologies (Drucker, 2011). These are the questions that I had always wished were addressed by people in STEM fields, and by those who believe in the objectivity of the “hard” sciences. Through a digital humanities approach I was able to utilize online government made data sets as supplementary evidence to the questions I pose on diaspora, which allowed me to paint a story of migration while still being critical of the data itself/how it was collected/who collected it.

<p class="demopara"> The first data set from the INEGI focuses on migration to the united states from mexico from 2016. The data does go further back to 1992, and I am still working on cleaning because they have not digitized the rest of the data, so I am essentially inputting those numbers from reports they have on their website manually. For now the visualization on the site just shows the 2016 number of migrations from each state in Mexico based off the population of each state. I appreciate this data set because it is one of the few data sets on migration to the US that shows the number of people migrating by state not just in general. Therefore, what I hope to show with this data is the migration patterns from the state of Guerrero and how they have changed since the early 1990s. Due to the rise of narco and state violence in Guerrero I am expecting the numbers to be rising, as more and more people flee for their safety.

<p class="demopara">Another data set I am working with from the INEGI shows the number of Indigenous Speakers in different cities of Guerrero, Mexico as of 2016. This data is limiting due to the fact that many Indigenous people tend to keep their native language a secret because of racism/state violence in Mexico, which means the data is not truly representative of the total population of speakers. Language is also not a sole indicator of how many Indigenous peoples there are in the general population, since not all Indigenous people speak their native language anymore. Even though most people who use these data sets use them as markers of Indigenous populations, they should be contested. Even with these limitations it was helpful for me to further complicate the conversation on who it is that is migrating. Up until recently migration from Latin American has been homogenized under a nation state identifier, such as these are “Mexican, Salvadorian, Peruvian” migrants. What I hope to show is that these waves of migration are predominately Indigenous, and the implications this will have on Indigenous communities both in the U.S. and their futures.

<p class="demopara">The last data set I am working with is from the Mexican consulate in the U.S., which is from an article written by Massey et. all (2010), which shows which cities have the largest migration from different states of Mexico. For this project I singled out the data that reflected the Guerrero Diasporic communities living in the United States. hope to show where exactly the largest populations of the diaspora are located within the U.S. to see what kind of community has formed there. For example, one of the cities largely populated by Guerrerenses is Santa Ana which has many community gatherings around food. I hope to add to this data set by later inputting Guerrerense Restaurants, utilizing google maps, to get a better sense of where else the Guerrero Diaspora may be present. Again, this specific data set just shows numbers gained from the Mexican consulate, which is not representative of all Guerrerenses in the United States.

<p class="demopara">Beyond working with premade data sets, I also set out to create my own “data” sets based off the recipes of my mother and grandmother. My goal was to create a living recipe book, for this  photographs and oral histories had to be collected (through digital photography and audio recording) and transcribed. As of now I only have an interview with my mom about the recipe we created on Picaditas. Creating this recipe took time, as I did not want to push her to share what she did not want. I took the approach that Smith (1999) proposing in decolonizing methodologies, of the importance of respect, relationality, and reciprocity when engaging with Indigenous people and conducting research together. Therefore, I do see my mother as a collaborating member of this project, without her knowledge and willingness to share it would not have been the same. I also understand that these recipes cannot be documented overnight, since many of these recipes come with memories (both good and bad) and it is not always easy to articulate or share those stories. It is important for me to note when my mother may be triggered by a memory or a story and to not push her too far. This process had taught me to be patient and that the answers I am looking for are there even when they are not voiced, or legible to the Eurocentric ways of knowing, all I had to do was listen and observe. I hope to continue collecting and writing recipes with my mom, and in the future open the site to submissions from the Guerrero Diaspora to see the transformations and continuities of our foods across the diaspora.
