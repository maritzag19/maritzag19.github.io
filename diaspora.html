<br> <h4> Guerrero, Mexico </h4>

<p class="demopara"> Located in southern Mexico, the state of Guerrero is home to Indigenous, African, and Mixed communities. This is where my family is from and where we have been for generations. It is home.

<p class="demopara"> Most recently it has come to be known as a state filled with violence caused by the narco-state, police, and Mexican-state as well. Perhaps most notably is the disappearance of the 43 missing college students of Ayotzinapa, who were on their way to a protest in Iguala when they were shot at and some kidnapped by the police. The communities in Guerrero, as well as all over the world have been in protest to find them ever since September of 2014. Still people have been reported missing or dead every day. I found this map (https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=1191195c7c184e4da8f94bba7b40914f) that shows the amount of people who have been murdered from 2011-2019. The image below shows just the numbers for 2019. </p>

<p class="demopara"> Although I was not able to get access to the data set, they worked with I felt it was important it to include a screen shot and link to the map.  Violence that fills the state is often centered in diasporic communities, who tend to flee from their homes out of necessity (Cohen, 2008). Since there has been a rise in state violence since the early 1990s, I hoped to also show how migration patterns have shifted over time. </p>

<p class="demopara">Using data from the INEGI from 2014, I show the number of migrants moving to the United States from each Mexican State and from Mexico as a whole (represented by the largest blue box). The different color gradients show which Mexican states have the larger number of migrations to the U.S. Guerrero is relatively low in comparison to other states in Mexico, which can be due to it being a southern state, making it harder to migrate north. I still wanted to know how many people from Guerrero have been migrating to the United States since the 1990s.

<p class="demopara">Working with the INEGI data sets on international migration from the years 2009, 2014, and 2018. I was able to show the migration patterns from three Mexican states. I wanted to highlight Guerrero Mexico, with two other states Michoacán which has also been under violent repression from the narco-state, and Oaxaca which has been a major focus in Indigenous Diaspora Studies. Using a line graph, we are able to compare the migration patterns from these three states. It is clear that migration has slowly declined since 2009, but since I do not have the data prior to 2009 I cannot be sure if migration was at an all-time high that year. Still it does appear that in the early 2000s there was a higher rate of migration for all three states, but Guerrero is still low throughout 2009,2014, 2018. I am still thinking through why migration from Guerrero is lower and feel it would be best to compliment this data with future interviews to get a better sense of why people migrate. Still it is clear that migration was higher during the rise of the narco-state, which is only worsening now,  with Guerrero and Michoacán communities migrating not just to the United States but also internally to places like Tijuana in hopes of escaping violence (https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/surge-of-mexican-migrants-is-new-challenge-for-trump-border-crackdown/2019/10/18/c40f6e72-f029-11e9-b648-76bcf86eb67e_story.html).

<p class="demopara">This Last visualization shows the total population alongside the population that speaks native languages in several cities within Guerrero. I wanted to show that Indigenous people still comprise a large part of Guerrero, Mexico, but what I found instead were the realities that many Indigenous communities are not speaking in their native language. Indigenous Language revitalization is something that is of big concern for the young Guerrerenses in Diaspora, and many have taken to University programs to re-learn their language. It is important to also point out that speaking an Indigenous language is not the sole marker of what marks someone as Indigenous, thus these numbers are not representative of how many Indigenous communities make up Guerrero. The numbers also show that Indigenous languages are mostly spoken outside of major cities, as seen in Acapulco, which is a major tourist city where many people may not even be from Guerrero. Still my purpose for making this line graph is to show that Indigenous peoples do comprise a good majority of the number of total migration to the U.S. In the future I would also like to include conversations around African migrations from Guerrero to the United States. Using the Mexican census, Valle Jones (2015) created a map (https://blog.diegovalle.net/2016/01/afro-mexicans.html
)  about the African communities in Mexico, where Guerrero is seen to have a big population of Afro-Mexican people . I also think that through interviews with the Guerrerenses Diaspora I will be able to get a more nuanced understanding of what Indigenous groups have migrated to the United States and get a more comprehensive total number.

<p class="demopara">These data sets were helpful over all to get an overall idea of migration patterns from Guerrero, Mexico and to see the complexities of who is migrating, such as Indigenous and African Guerrerenses. Overall, I still think that interviews would be helpful in bringing life into these data sets, and in the future, I hope to add oral histories that can help nuance some of this data.

<br> <h4> Anaheim, CA </h4>

<p class="demopara">I was raised in Anaheim, California also known as the happiest place on earth. Often living in the shadows of Disneyland, this also became our home. My mother already had many friends who had also migrated in the early 1990s to Anaheim. Growing up there felt like we knew everyone, and everyone knew us. It was an urban center but to me it felt like Guerrero. It felt like everyone from Guerrero had moved to Orange County. Working with the data set from the Mexican consulate it turns out Santa Ana, CA holds the second largest population of Guerrerenses. I have mapped out the rest of the cities below, which shows that a majority of people from Guerrero have moved to Illinois. This data shows that the Guerrero diasporic community has formed in major urban centers, and I am interested to see how those spaces are shaped or influenced by their presence. In future work I aim to highlight both Orange County and Chicago, Illinois as spaces that Guerrerenses have made into their homes in diaspora. I also plan to add a layer to this map, which features the Guerrero restaurants (using google maps) in the United States, to see where else the diaspora may be located. </p>

<p class="demopara">I include these last images from Google maps to show the differences between where my family comes from in Huitzuco, Guerrero to where we moved to, Anaheim, CA. Both are our home in different ways. Anaheim is all I have ever known; it is the community that raised me and yet Guerrero plays such an important role in shaping my Indigenous cultural identity. In the next section on recipes, I explore more about what it means to be in Diaspora and the importance of food in maintaining identity both from a personal perspective and by interviewing my mom.
