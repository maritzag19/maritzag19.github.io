<br> <p class="demopara"> You start by working the masa. When you buy it grounded up at the market it will be somewhat dry so it is important to add water to it (if you are using the grounded up masa then you still want to add water to it). When you are working the masa be sure to keep water nearby, putting some on your hands if they get dry, this reduces the chances of masa getting stuck to your fingers. Work the masa until it is soft to the touch and then you can start forming the tortillas. </p>

<br> <p class="demopara">The tortillas are formed by placing a small ball of masa in your hands. Roll it until it becomes a nice circular ball, then flatten it by tossing it back and forth in your hands. Once it becomes a flat(ish) circle 5”x5” then you can place it on the comal (the pan). Let one side of the tortilla cook for about 30 seconds and then flip the tortilla over to let the other side cook (30 seconds or so), flip the tortilla once more and it should begin to inflate. Once the tortilla inflates (rises building air in the middle) it means it is cooked. You should have about 10-12 tortillas from 1 pound of masa.  </p>

<br> <img class= "tortillascooking" src="img/tortillasinflate.jpeg" alt= "tortillas inflate" align="left">

<br> <p class="demopara"> Once the tortillas are cooked you quickly want to picarlas (pinch the edges) while the tortillas are still hot, in order to mold the shape of the picadita. The tortilla will be hot so if you are not used to working with hot foods, feel free to use a napkin or cloth to pinch the edges of the tortilla. At the end the tortillas should look like small dishes where the center will be filled with toppings. Add oil (any kind) to the inside of the formed picaditas and spread it around the edges too. You will then place them on a hot skillet face side down to get the edges crisp. You will flip them over after 2-3 minutes and began adding the toppings.  </p>

<br> <p class="demopara"> Meanwhile you will also be making you salsa which is the main topping of this dish. This salsa requires you to remove the seeds from the chilis and then toast the chilis over a hot flame or on a hot pan until they are fragrant (do not burn or it will sour the taste). After toasting the chilis you will let them soak in water for about 5-10 minutes. Meanwhile toast your tomatillos and garlics on a pan until charred. Now place the chilis, tomatillos, and garlic into a blender (add salt to taste) and blend (use the water you soaked the chilis in, to adjust consistency of the salsa). The salsa should be smooth but still thick and will be used later as a topping. </p>

<br> <p class="demopara"> The picaditas at this point should be cooking on the skillet with oil, once they are face side up it is time to assemble them.  First add the red salsa, then the onions, then the sour cream, and lastly the cheese. Wait 5 minutes or until cheese melts. Now they are ready to serve and are best ate while they are still hot. Enjoy them with your loved ones! </p>

<br> <h2> Food Stories </h2>

<p class="demopara"> We spent a whole evening making this picadita recipe with my mother and my grandmother. I had told my mom to share one recipe with me that was part of our family and the region of Huitzuco, Guerrero. The picaditas recipe is different than say the more well-known sope, which is deep fried and contains meat and lettuce. Picaditas are simple my mom says, and so she wanted to share this simple dish to begin sharing and writing down our familial traditional recipes.

<p class="demopara">We called my grandma via whatsapp, she lives in Acapulco, Guerrero, but through these digital devices it does make it feel like spatial distance collapses. As my mom is teaching me, my grandmother kindly interrupts to add something about her specific way of doing things. We all laugh, it feels like we are in the same room. My mother has not seen her mother in person in over 24 years, so making these recipes together is her way of affirming what her mom taught her is still important to her. These recipes to me represent a connection through food that can be felt even when we may not be able to be physically present with each other. I feel a deeply happy, yet am trying to hold back tears, as I move around to capture all these pictures and try to take notes of what my mother and grandmother are saying. Not only does space feel collapsed, temporality is also challenged. My mother makes this recipe using her hands to work the masa the way her mother taught her, our original technologies. Yet my grandma laughs now saying that she has switched over to using a tortilla press now because its faster. Our ancient recipes and food technologies combine with the modern world we inhabit. It reminds me that we survived, we were not meant to survive genocide, but we are still here. These foods keep alive our spirits and our Indigenous ways of being and knowing. Even when our orginal language has been forced out of us, even when we no longer remember the name of our people, we still remember who we are through our food. I look how happy my grandmother looks over facetime, its one of those smiles, the ones that say “you are on the right path, keep going, you are almost there”. Her reaffirming smile and my mother’s joy are what give this food life. We are still here and we will continue to be here.

<p class="demopara">Reflecting on the process several weeks later I sit down to have a conversation with my mother about what she felt when we were making these together, on why she thinks it is important to share these recipes with me, and then I asked how she felt about me documenting these in both written and digital formats.

<p class="demopara">I ask my mother to share a memory that she has about eating or making picaditas. She starts by placing us in Huitzuco, Guerrero in our home. “Outside there is the kitchen stove, bracero, where my mother kept her metate (volcanic stone grinder-used for making masa) where she would form the masa, and next to it was the comal (the skillet), and we would all gather around her ready to eat them as soon as they were ready. She would make them on a Sunday, and it was a family reunion, we were happy.”

<p class="demopara">I then ask her about how she felt when we were talking to my grandmother via facetime, and if it was may a similar experience even though we are miles apart?

<p class="demopara">“Yes, it is that even despite the distance, we were able to connect, we were able to recreate that same feeling because we were making the picaditas together even if it was via the web, we were able to connect as a family. We were able to feel that beautiful sensation of being able to make something as a family.” She makes sure to encourage all who are engaging with this recipe to try to make them with your loved ones, to spend time cooking together to feel what we felt when making these picaditas. “What is most fun is being able to talk, laugh, learn from one another. Like for example in our case it was also an intergenerational exchange, your grandma was there sharing with us, and I was teaching you how to make them too. And later you can share this recipe with your friends and those around you. But what matters is this practice of making them with others in unity. That way when you sit down to eat you feel happy. It’s a whole experience”

<p class="demopara">Then I tell her from what I know we do not have any of these recipes written down, they have all be passed down orally right? And then how do you feel about me writing them down?

<p class="demopara">“Well I think it’s a good thing that they being written, but yes traditionally it was all passed down orally. We had to save it in our memory not on a computer or on paper. We never wrote them down, maybe I thought or I felt that my parents would be here with me always and that I could call them and they would be there. But even my mother didn’t right a book of recipes, she has it all written in her memory and they just share it with us, they teach it to us so that we can remember it, but even then I never took notes of what I learned I just learned as I went along. Still I do think it is important to write them down, for one it allows you to share them with a lot more people. If you only share them via oral tradition you can also learn, but you might forget something. Our parents they tell us the specifics of the recipes but don’t have them written down, and so I think it is important to share them in written format.”

<p class="demopara">Even you taught us like this through oral stories, you would simply tell us to watch you when you cooked, and that’s how you expected us to learn. I go on to explain to her why I want to write these recipes down, to archive them, because they do matter, and I don’t want to forget those little details. The archives you carry in your mind, I think are important too.

<p class="demopara">“yes, they are important because sometimes when our parents are no longer here, or when we can no longer be with our parents, then we have these recipes written down so that we can continue to make them. So even when our family members move on, we can keep it alive.”
